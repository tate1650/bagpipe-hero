   Press the number keys of the keyboard (1-9) to play
the chanter and make different notes! You get points
for hitting the blue notes and turning them green, but
if you miss the notes or hit the wrong key, they turn
red and you don't get points. Also, watch the bagpipe 
meter at the side of the screen. Click the "FILL BAG" 
button to refill the bag and keep the drones playing.
You can't score points with an empty meter. Also, quick
hint: playing with nine fingers is tough, so here's a trick.
Try using your four non-thumb fingers for 1-8 and 
moving your right pinkie over when you need to click 9.
   That's all you need! Good luck!

To select a song to play, type in the title of the song
to see if it is available. Make sure the song is
present in the folder "Code and Relevant Files > Music > Playable Songs"
that came with this game, and make sure the title
of the song is in the sound file name. Press enter 
to submit your choice. If you don't want to pick 
a specific song, just press enter right away, and a 
random song will be given to you!

Also, as another tip, you can add songs to play to the
game by simply putting .wav files into the folder
"Code and Relevant Files > Music > Playable Songs" that
came with this game. Have fun, and good luck!

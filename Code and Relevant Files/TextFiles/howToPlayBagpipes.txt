   Welcome to my game! Hopefully by the playing it, you 
will soon have a better appreciate and understand of 
the Highland Bagpipe, a cool and fun, albeit complicated
instrument to play.
   The bagpipe works like this: the player blows into the 
blowpipe to fill the bag with air. They push the bag 
against their body to make the deep drones play in the 
background and make the loud, squeaky chanter play. They
use their hands to play one of nine different notes on 
the chanter. A helpful diagram of the Highland Bagpipe
is shown to the right.
